# Edzy UI Guidelines & Rules

## 1. Core UI Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

**Calm, human, transactional.**
This is not entertainment. It is money, time, and trust.

### Rules:
- No visual noise
- No "fun for fun's sake"
- Every element must answer: **Does this increase trust or speed?**
- If an element doesn't do one of those two, cut it.

---

## 2. Hero Section UI Rules

### Layout
- Two-column max (text + visual)
- Visual must never overpower the headline
- Primary CTA on the left, secondary on the right

### Typography
- Headline: DM Serif (confidence, maturity)
- Subtext: Neutral sans (Inter or system UI)
- Line length ≤ 65 characters

### Visual Ideas (Instead of cartoon people)
- Subscription cards floating in perspective
- Dashboard preview with blurred sensitive data
- Abstract shapes + service logos

### CTA Rules
- Primary CTA = action + reward: "Recevoir mon abonnement"
- Secondary CTA = exploration: "Voir les offres"

---

## 3. Trust Badges & Proof Design

### UI Ideas
- Small pill badges with icons
- Muted green background for reassurance
- Never stack more than 4 at once

### Content Rules
- ❌ Bad: "Garantie active"
- ✅ Good: "Garantie 30 jours • Remboursement ou remplacement"
- **Clarity beats marketing.**

---

## 4. Brand Logo Strip

### UI Ideas
- Monochrome logos
- Reduced opacity (70%)
- Hover restores full opacity

### Rule
Logos must support, not dominate. They are background confidence, not headlines.

---

## 5. How It Works Section

### Visual Structure
- Horizontal steps on desktop
- Vertical timeline on mobile

### UI Ideas
- Step numbers inside soft circles
- Micro-icons per step
- Subtle connecting line (dashed)

### Copy Rules
Each step:
- Max 6 words title
- One line explanation

Example:
```
Payez
Par BaridiMob ou CCP
```

---

## 6. Product Grid (Subscription Cards)

### Card Anatomy
- Product logo
- Name + tier
- One killer benefit
- Price in DZD (dominant)
- CTA

### UI Rules
- Most popular = slightly larger card
- Never more than 4 cards per row
- Hover = elevation + shadow, not animation chaos

### CTA Copy Guide
- ❌ Avoid: "View offer"
- ✅ Use: "Activer maintenant", "Commander", "Recevoir en 30 min"

---

## 7. Price Comparison Table

### UI Ideas
- Highlight Edzy column softly
- Use green only for savings
- Strike-through official prices lightly

### Rules
- Always add "prix indicatifs"
- Update cadence must be defined (weekly or monthly)
- No update = remove the table

---

## 8. Testimonials UI

### Structure
- Avatar (initials are fine)
- Name + city
- Product used
- Short, specific feedback

### UI Rules
- No long paragraphs
- No fake enthusiasm
- Ratings visible but not oversized
- **Authenticity > excitement**

---

## 9. FAQ Section

### UI Ideas
- Soft cards
- Chevron animation only
- One open at a time

### Content Rules
- Answer directly
- Avoid legal language
- Add reassurance at the end

Example:
> "Oui, et si ça ne marche pas, on vous remplace ou rembourse."

---

## 10. Chat Widget (AI + WhatsApp)

### UI Ideas
- Friendly but neutral avatar
- Clear labels: "Assistant" vs "Humain"

### Rules
- AI never handles disputes
- AI never promises refunds
- Always show WhatsApp fallback
- **Trust escalation must be visible**

---

## 11. Product Detail Pages

### UI Structure
- Left: product info
- Right: purchase box (sticky on desktop)

### UI Ideas

- Progress indicator always visible

### UI Ideas
- Receipt upload with preview
- Example image tooltip
- Success screen with next steps

### Rule

## 13. Admin Dashboard UI (Internal but Critical)

### UI Ideas
- KPI cards at top
- Charts below
- Tables last

### Rules
- Red = problems only
- Green = completed only
- No decorative charts
- **This is an ops cockpit, not a marketing page**

---

## 14. Arabic / Darija / RTL Rules

### Typography

- Body: simple, readable Arabic font

### RTL Rules
- Mirror layout, don't just flip text
